# Util

 - `run_tests.sh`: Wrapper script used by the makefile to invoke varnishtest against the VCL files in this repo.
 - `docker_tests.sh`: (**:warning:** this is a HACK/WIP!): export `VARNISH_VERSIONS` to be a space-separated list of varnish versions to test against and run `./util/docker_tests.sh`.
